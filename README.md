# Burundi flooding support

Rainfall analysis for Burundi.

## Reproducing this analysis

Create a directory where you would like the data to be stored,
and point to it using an environment variable called
`AA_DATA_DIR`.

Next create a new virtual environment and install the requirements with:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Finally, install any code in `src` using the command:

```shell
pip install -e .
```

To run the pipeline that downloads and processes the data, execute:

```shell
python src/main.py
```

To see runtime options, execute:

```shell
python src/main.py -h
```

If you would like to instead receive the processed data from our team, please

## Development

All code is formatted according to black and flake8 guidelines.
The repo is set-up to use pre-commit.
Before you start developing in this repository, you will need to run

```shell
pre-commit install
```

The `markdownlint` hook will require
[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
to be installed on your computer.

You can run all hooks against all your files using

```shell
pre-commit run --all-files
```

It is also **strongly** recommended to use `jupytext`
to convert all Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) to Markdown files (`.md`)
before committing them into version control. This will make for
cleaner diffs (and thus easier code reviews) and will ensure that cell outputs aren't
committed to the repo (which might be problematic if working with sensitive data).
